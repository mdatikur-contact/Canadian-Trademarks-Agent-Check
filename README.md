# Agent Check - Canadian Trademark Database Automation 🛠️🇨🇦

**Agent Check** is a simple yet powerful web-based tool designed to automate the process of verifying agents in the Canadian Trademark Database. This project has been a game-changer in saving time and improving efficiency for my data entry work.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Agent Verification:** Automatically checks if an agent is associated with a given ID in the Canadian Trademark Database.
- **Skip IDs with Agents:** Automatically skips IDs that already have agents.
- **Batch Processing:** Input multiple IDs at once, and the tool processes them in one go.
- **Real-Time Results:** Displays results dynamically in a clean and organized table format.
- **Time-Saving:** Saves up to 80% of the time compared to manual checks.

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. **Enter IDs:** Copy and paste the IDs you want to check (one per line) into the input box.
2. **Check Agents:** Click the `Check Agent` button, and the tool will verify each ID one by one.
3. **View Results:** The results, including whether an agent is found or not, will be displayed in a table.
4. **Notification:** After processing all IDs, you'll see a success message, ensuring the task is completed.

## 📖 Why I Built This
As a data entry worker, I spent countless hours manually verifying agent information in the Canadian Trademark Database. The repetitive nature of the task consumed valuable time and effort. This small project was born out of necessity, and it has transformed my workflow, saving **80% of my time** and improving my productivity dramatically.

## 🌟 Impact
- **Efficiency Boost:** Automated agent verification reduces manual effort and errors.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Focus more on meaningful tasks by eliminating repetitive processes.
- **Empowering Automation:** Demonstrates the power of small, impactful projects in solving real-world problems.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** API integration with Canadian Trademark Database (Localhost simulation in the demo)
